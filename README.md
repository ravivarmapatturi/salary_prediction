### Project Description: Salary Prediction Web Application

This project involves building a machine learning web application to predict salaries using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023. The application was developed from scratch in Python using the Streamlit framework, which allows for the easy creation of interactive web applications.

#### Key Features:

1. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - The dataset was sourced from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023, providing real-world insights into developers' salaries based on various factors such as experience, education, and job roles.
   - The data was thoroughly analyzed to identify trends and patterns that could influence salary predictions.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Various machine learning algorithms were tested and evaluated to find the best model for salary prediction. This included experimenting with different features, preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
   - The final model was chosen based on its accuracy and ability to generalize well to new data.

3. **Web Application Development**:
   - The chosen model was integrated into a web application built using Streamlit. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to input relevant data and receive salary predictions.
   - Users can explore the impact of different variables on predicted salaries, making it a valuable tool for understanding salary dynamics in the tech industry.
