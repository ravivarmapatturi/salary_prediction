# Salary Prediction Web Application

This project involves building a machine learning web application to predict developer salaries using data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023. The application was developed from scratch in Python using the Streamlit framework, which allows for the creation of interactive web applications.

## Key Features:

### Data Collection and Analysis:
- **Dataset**: Sourced from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023, providing real-world insights into developer salaries based on various factors such as experience, education, and job roles.
- **Data Analysis**: The data was analyzed to identify trends and patterns that could influence salary predictions.

### Model Building:
- Various machine learning algorithms were tested and evaluated to find the best model for salary prediction.
- Features were selected, preprocessing techniques were applied, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.
- The final model was chosen for its accuracy and ability to generalize well to new data.

### Web Application Development:
- The selected model was integrated into a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit.
- Users can input relevant data (experience, education, job roles) and receive salary predictions based on the trained model.
- The application allows users to explore the impact of different variables on predicted salaries, making it a valuable tool for understanding salary dynamics in the tech industry.

## How to Run the Application:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravivarmapatturi/salary_prediction.git
